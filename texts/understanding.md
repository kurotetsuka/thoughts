## Understanding

I understand. Enlightenment, i have achieved, yet i'm not certain it helps me. The nature of reality is apparent to me, yet still my problems are unsolved. Perhaps now my mind is simple and uncomplicated in ways that others' are convoluted. Perhaps I've wasted years figuring out what everyone else knew all along. Alternatively, maybe i've finally rediscovered that ancient secret that the legendary minds of lore were revered for. Are all of the above true?
