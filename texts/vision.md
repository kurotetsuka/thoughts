## Vision

This one has a vision - a vision of a perfect world for all. Some would mock it for such idealism and naivite. Many would disregard it for superficial incoherence. Most, would never even consider it. A few, however, might discard the shackles of realism, come to appreciate the beauty of such a thought and yearn deeply for its realization. To those few, this one speaks.
