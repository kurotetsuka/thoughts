## Vision

This one has a vision - a vision of a perfect world for all. Some would mock it for such idealism and naivite. Many would disregard it for superficial incoherence. Most, would never even consider it. A few, however, might discard the shackles of realism, come to appreciate the beauty of such a thought and yearn deeply for its realization. To those few, this one speaks.

We pain ourselves. We make such great effort, just to pain ourselves. We justify this pain by claiming, often to none but ourselves, it is necessary. It is not necessary, nor has it ever been.

Some call adherence to pain 'discipline'. Such a thought is misguided. Discipline is not the adherence, but the willful ignorance of pain. Such ignorance is not difficult, if one truly wills it. Adhering to pain one does not will to ignore is foolish and dishonest. If one would instead inspect, understand, then address their conflicts of will, one's pain will vanish, evaporated into meaningless noise. Ignorance of noise is a simple matter.



We must not pain ourselves. We must overcome our conflicts of will, achieve balance in desire, but we must not pain ourselves.
