## vision

This one has a vision - a vision of a perfect world for all. Some would mock it for such idealism and naivite. Many would disregard it for superficial incoherence. Most would never even consider it. A few, however, might discard the shackles of realism, come to appreciate the beauty of such a thought and yearn deeply for its realization. To those few, this one speaks, despite the scorn that shall undoubtedly be laid against it.

We pain ourselves. We go to great lenghts, just to pain ourselves. We justify this pain by claiming, often to none but ourselves, it is necessary. It is not necessary, nor has it ever been. Some call this adherence to pain discipline. Such a thought is misguided. Discipline is not the adherence, but the willful ignorance of pain. Such ignorance is not difficult, if one truly wills it. Adhering to pain one does not will to ignore is foolish and dishonest. If one would instead inspect, understand, then address their conflicts of will, one's pain will vanish, evaporated into meaningless noise. Ignorance of noise is a simple matter.
