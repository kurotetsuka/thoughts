## Big Crystallization

Instead of a Big Crunch, Rip, Bounce, Freeze, etc, the universe could converge into a crystalline structure.

If black holes are shells instead of vacuums or erasers, its possible the universe could converge into some giant stable crystal, instead of any of the fates listed here: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe#Theories_about_the_end_of_the_universe). This crystal doesn't even need to be temporally static, it could be a [time crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time_crystal). This particularly fits with the idea that our universe is just a giant optimization problem.
