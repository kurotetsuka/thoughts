### introduction

We pain ourselves. We make such great effort, just to pain ourselves. We justify this pain by claiming, often to none but ourselves, it is necessary. It is not necessary, nor has it ever been.

Some call adherence to pain 'discipline'. Such a thought is misguided. Discipline is not the adherence, but rather the willful ignorance of pain. Such ignorance is not difficult, if one truly wills it. Adhering to pain one does not will to ignore is foolish and dishonest. If one would instead inspect, understand, then address their conflicts of will, one's pain will vanish, evaporated into meaningless noise. Ignorance of noise is a simple matter.

We must not pain ourselves. We must overcome our conflicts of will, achieve balance in desire, but we must not pain ourselves.
