## Terminal is the Best

Programming without a (good) terminal is like trying to build a house without a hammer. Sure, I guess one could use the back of a screwdriver, but that's just a little silly. Maybe one could make a nice nail-hitting screwdriver - heavy, with a wide base and a smaller screwing part, but then isn't that just a really shitty hammer ( that's also a shitty screwdriver )? Wouldn't it make so much more sense to just hammer with a hammer, and screw with a screwdriver?

Adding numerous development features to your text editor is just like making that screwdriver into a shitty screw-hammer. Use your terminal for running your development tasks and your text editor for coding. Its literally what both are respectively designed for.
