## Lonely Poem

~~~

Solely in these moments,

         alone,

    is the beauty of my

           quiet world

apparent to me



Around others,

         what can you hear?:

     their overbearing spirits,

  the noise of their minds,

      the loudness of many voices -

and one becomes many.



But when one is simply one,

           a world slips away,

   meaning becomes meaningless,

          noise becomes signal -

and one becomes none.



While no one

     may be at peace

         with this world,
perhaps one might.
