## I Miss Our Love

~~~

  I miss the way you loved me.

  I miss the way you'd look at me,
         the way your eyes shone -
         like the moon on a clear night -
         your gaze pierced me.

  I miss the way you'd hold me,
         the way your fingers traced my back -
         like the brush on parchment -
         your caress defined me.

  I miss the way you'd smile,
         the way your lips curved gently  -
         like the bloom of spring -
         your essence enveloped me.

  I miss the way we loved each other,
         the fire between us -
             embers of which we still hold
         the tangle of our souls -
            the knots we'll never unravel,
         the bond of our spirit -
             flames independant yet interlaced.

  I miss the way you loved me,
         yet through it all,
         I love you still.
  I love the gazes we still share,
         the touches of fingers,
         the tender words,
         the affect that remains.

  You speak my name.
  A gentle spark ignites,
  coursing through my body.
  Reminicing the storm -
  I love you all over again.
